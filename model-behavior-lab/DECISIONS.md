# Decisions Log

This document records major decisions for the Model Behavior Lab to keep experiments reproducible and auditable.

## 2024-01-01
- Established the repository structure with a single `appointment-adherence` experiment and dedicated `notes/` documentation.
- Committed to synthetic data generation with explicit confounding and intervention effects to surface explanation paradoxes.
- Standardized model variants (A–D) to compare ratio features, count-only baselines, monotonic constraints, and interpretable models.
