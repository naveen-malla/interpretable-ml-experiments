# Clinician Trust Guidelines

- **Avoid paradoxical narratives**: Do not surface explanations that imply higher adherence increases no-show risk without a clinical justification.
- **Show denominators**: When presenting ratios, always disclose the underlying counts.
- **Highlight intervention effects**: If the model is trained on data with implicit interventions, explanations should warn that risk signals may be attenuated by extra support.
- **Use monotonic models for adherence**: Clinicians expect that more missed appointments increase risk; violating this expectation erodes trust.
